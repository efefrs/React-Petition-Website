Type nodemon into vscode terminal.

Please note that node_modules is empty to make submission easier,
from my testing you'll need to 'npm install http-errors' before nodemon will work.

PLEASE NOTE: I didn't change the UI of the backend at all. That means you can add
supporters from the backend page as well. The assignment didn't specify if we needed
to clear the webpage so the backend is a 
fully functioning webpage as well (even though it isn't meant to be used as a webpage)
